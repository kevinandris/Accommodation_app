#  Constraints:
   1) Some property pictures are not well presented on the website which made the love icon invisible for users.

#  Personal Opinion on Improving Self-Skills in Coding:
   1) Pay extra attention wheh writing words to ensure that each work is spelled correctly.
   2) Be active to compile the code every time I create a function to avoid blank/white screen
      and due to unimported/outedated dependecies, files etc to save lots of time.
   3) It is effective to gather all the necessary images, icons or font family from google font for 
      example before implementing the code for time efficiency.
